# Improving Visual Landmark Detection and Matching for Video-based Mapping using NeRF-based View Generation and Self-Supervised Machine Learning

The project aims to enhance [SuperPoint](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.07629), a real-time feature point detection and description tool, by incorporating advanced techniques such as [NeRF](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.08934)-based view generation and self-supervised machine learning. The proposed approach focuses on improving the model's geometric consistency and overall performance. 

***This project is currently a work in progress***
